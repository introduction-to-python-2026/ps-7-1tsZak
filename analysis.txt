Analysis of Political Ideology vs Happiness

From the scatter plot and histogram, we can observe the following:

1. Most of the left-leaning countries (Political Ideology < 4) are in Northern Europe
   and tend to have high happiness scores (around 7.4–7.8).

2. Center-leaning countries (Political Ideology 4–6) show a wide range of happiness scores,
   generally between 6.0–7.2.

3. Right-leaning countries (Political Ideology > 6) tend to have slightly lower happiness
   scores, often around 4.8–6.0, with some exceptions.

4. The histogram shows that most countries in this dataset are center-to-right leaning,
   with fewer extreme left countries.

5. Overall, there seems to be a negative correlation between political ideology (Left → Right)
   and happiness in this dataset: as countries become more right-leaning, their average
   happiness score slightly decreases. However, this is a small sample, so it should
   not be generalized without further data.

Conclusion:
Happiness appears higher in more left-leaning countries in this dataset, while right-leaning
countries tend to have slightly lower happiness scores. This aligns with some global
happiness and policy research.
